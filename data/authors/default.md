A recent Bachelor of Science in Computer Science graduate from the University of Vermont moving into the next stage of my life.
I love programming in any context, but a few of my favorite fields are desktop applications, machine learning, and graphics / games.
My preferred languages are C++, Python and C#. I also have experience with Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript / Typescript, SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite),
React, Unity3D, RayLib.

I currently am looking into many fields of software development and am happy to hear about any opportunities that are out there. Feel
free to reach out to me at any of my provided contact links. I look forward to continuing this journey in a new chapter of my life!
